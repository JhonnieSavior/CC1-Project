<p style="font-family:courier; font-size:20px ;color:LightGray">by LARA SILVA</p>
<p style="font-family:courier; font-size:15px;color:Gray" ><mark>Around and around the mind goes,<br>
Where it’ll stop, I sadly don’t know.<br>
<br>
Thrashing about like a chainéd beast,<br>
Violently making my soul its feast.<br>
<br>
It is my comfort, this untamed mind.<br>
A cold, dark comfort, That makes me blind.<br>
<br>
I forget the wonder, the mystery and grace,<br>
Enslaved to its wreckage, I forget my own face.<br>
<br>
When I catch its sight, in the mirror or glass,<br>
I’m amazed at my image, the steep contrast<br>
<br>
In my mind I’m a derelict, deformed, defaced,<br>
A failure, unloveable, a relic of waste.<br>
<br>
Yet in the mirror, the beauty is clear.<br>
Vulnerable, innocent, a heart without fear.<br>
 <br>
I’m a lover, a hero, a friend, a queen,<br>
The smile, often hid is where joy is seen.<br>
<br>
Who is this figure? This woman, this girl?<br>
A child of God, a sail still furled.<br>
<br>
I despise my chains, this darkness so deep,<br>
I hunger for courage to take a leap.<br>
<br>
My faith has been lost, my compass is broke.<br>
Banishéd are, the last grains of hope.<br>
<br>
So, I raise my arms to the heavens so dear<br>
To my father, I call, “Take away this fear!”<br>
<br>
Or give me respite, a moment, a truce<br>
So I can salvage my soul, loosen this noose<br>
<br>
It’s too soon to hang limp, to dangle and die<br>
If I am saying “I give up,” know it’s a lie.<br>
<br>
I AM a fighter, a phoenix, a blessing, a curse.<br>
For all the pain I have suffered I know there is worse.<br>
<br>
I’m lucky, I’m blessed by heaven and man<br>
If I pry open my heart, I’ll find a friend at each hand.<br>
 <br>
“Alone” is a lie in the gloom of my brain.<br>
“Unloved” is a land of make-believe pain.<br>
<br>
I’m here, I belong, to live and to thrive,<br>
I will not give up while I’m still alive.</mark></p>
